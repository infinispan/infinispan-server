		<h2>Welcome to the JDG REST Server</h2>
		<p>
			This server provides easy to use <a
				target='info' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a>
			access to the Data Grid. See below for usage details.
		</p>

		<h4>1. Configuration</h4>
		<p>
			Out of the box, JBoss Data Grid will use its default cache defined in
			&lt;JDG_HOME&gt;/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
			. To set a custom configuration, modify the configuration file and
			restart JBoss Data Grid.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please note that the REST server only allows interaction with either
			the default cache, named <em><strong>default</strong></em>
			or one of the named caches in the configuration file. This is because
			the REST server starts default and pre-defined caches on startup in
			order to provide a more consistent behaivour.
		</p>

		<p>
			<a target="docs" href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/InfinispanRESTserver">The
				chapter</a> in the community user guide has more details.
		</p>

		<h4>2. Putting data in</h4>
		<p>
			HTTP PUT and POST methods are used to place data in the cache - the
			data being the body of the request (the data can be anything you
			like). It is important that a
			Content-Type
			header is set.
		</p>
		<h6>PUT /rest/{cacheName}/{cacheKey}</h6>
		<p>
			A PUT request of the above URL form will place the payload (body) in
			the given cache, with the given key (if the cache name is new, it
			will be automatically initialised). For example
			http://someserver/rest/hr/payRoll/3
			(in which case
			hr
			is the cache name, and
			payRoll/3
			is the key). Any existing data will be replaced, and
			Time-To-Live
			and
			Last-Modified
			values will updated (if applicable).
		</p>
		<h6>POST /rest/{cacheName}/{cacheKey}</h6>
		<p>
			Exactly the same as PUT, only if a value in a cache/key already
			exists, it will return a HTTP
			CONFLICT
			status (and the content will not be updated).
		</p>

		<h6>Headers:</h6>
		<p>The following HTTP headers are supported:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Header Name</th>
				<th>Required?</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Content-Type</td>
				<td>Yes</td>
				<td>Use <a target='info'  href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">media/mime-types</a>,
					for example "application/json"
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>timeToLiveSeconds</td>
				<td>No</td>
				<td>The number of seconds before this entry will automatically
					be deleted</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>maxIdleTimeSeconds</td>
				<td>No</td>
				<td>The number of seconds after last usage of this entry when
					it will automatically be deleted</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>performAsync</td>
				<td>No</td>
				<td>If true, this will return immediately, and then replicate
					data to the cluster on its own. Can help with bulk data
					inserts/large clusters.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h4>3. Getting data back out</h4>
		<p>HTTP GET and HEAD are used to retrieve data from entries.</p>

		<h6>GET /rest/{cacheName}/{cacheKey}</h6>
		<p>
			This will return the data found in the given cache name, under the
			given key - as the body of the response. A
			Content-Type
			header will be supplied which matches what the data was inserted as.
			Browsers can use the cache directly of course (e.g., as a <a
				target='info'  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a>).
		</p>
		<p>
			An <a target='info' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag">ETag</a> will be
			returned unique for each entry, as will the
			Last-Modified
			header field indicating the state of the data at the given URL. ETags
			allow browsers (and other clients) to ask for data only in the case
			where it has changed (to save on bandwidth) - this is standard HTTP
			and is honored by JBoss Data Grid.
		</p>
		<h6>HEAD /rest/{cacheName}/{cacheKey}</h6>
		<p>The same as GET, only no content is returned (only the header
			fields).</p>

		<h4>4. Removing data</h4>
		Data can be removed at the cache key/element level, or via a whole
		cache name using the HTTP delete method.
		<h6>DELETE /rest/{cacheName}/{cacheKey}</h6>
		<p>Removes the given key name from the cache.</p>
		<h6>DELETE /rest/{cacheName}</h6>
		<p>Removes ALL the entries in the given cache name (ie everything
			from that path down).</p>
		<p>
			OPTIONAL: Set the header
			performAsync
			to
			true
			to return immediately and let the removal happen in the background.
		</p>

		<h4>5. Clients</h4>
		Any HTTP client will do - from any language. See <a
			target='docs' href="http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/InfinispanRESTserver">here</a>
		for more details.

		<h4>6. Deployment</h4>
		Enterprise Data Grid is a distributed data grid, it shouldn't matter
		how many or which instance of the Server you access, as long as it is
		part of the Enterprise Data Grid cluster, it will find your data, and
		manage it. You can have as many instances (including the one you are
		looking at) as you need.
